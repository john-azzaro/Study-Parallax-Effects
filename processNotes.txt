Process Notes
==============

So this is a study on parallax.  But what is parallax exactly?  To put this in context, think
of a normal website with a fixed background image.  When you scroll down, the image will stay as is.  
However, the magic happens when you start using parallax.  When you use a static image, it will remain 
static while the content moves over the image as you scroll down the page.  With the parallax effect, both
the image AND the content move as you move down the page.


STEP 1: create an html page
=============================
-- in this example, we'll just use a h1 and h3 element, and a few pictures of delicious fruit.
