Process Notes
==============
So this is a study on parallax.  But what is parallax exactly?  To put this in context, think
of a normal website with a fixed background image.  When you scroll down, the image will stay as is.  
However, the magic happens when you start using parallax.  When you use a static image, it will remain 
static while the content moves over the image as you scroll down the page.  With the parallax effect, both
the image AND the content move as you move down the page.



STEP 1: create an html page
=============================
-- in this example, we'll just use a h1 and h3 element, and a few pictures of delicious fruit.


STEP 2: Set up the css for the elements you want to apply the parallax effect to:
=================================================================================
--  This involves setting each of the images and elements you want to "absolute" so that they are outside 
    normal flow and can be offset.
--  So for example, when you apply "position: absolute" to the kiwi image, it will be set with absolute positioning
    relative to the parent container, which in this case is the header.  
--  Then when you set the absolute positioning, you can set the horizontal and vertical alignments with top and right
--  Now for transform and translate.
    --  When you use transform, you apply 2d transformation to the element.
    --  When you use translate, and in this case match the x and y axis to the the top and right/left positioning, you apply 
        a negative to it to essentially match it and bring it to where you want it.
