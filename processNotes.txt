Process Notes
==============
So this is a study on parallax.  But what is parallax exactly?  To put this in context, think
of a normal website with a fixed background image.  When you scroll down, the image will stay as is.  
However, the magic happens when you start using parallax.  When you use a static image, it will remain 
static while the content moves over the image as you scroll down the page.  With the parallax effect, both
the image AND the content move as you move down the page.



STEP 1: create an html page
=============================
-- in this example, we'll just use a h1 and h3 element, and a few pictures of delicious fruit.


STEP 2: Set up the css for the elements you want to apply the parallax effect to:
=================================================================================
--  This involves setting each of the images and elements you want to "absolute" so that they are outside 
    normal flow and can be offset.
--  So for example, when you apply "position: absolute" to the kiwi image, it will be set with absolute positioning
    relative to the parent container, which in this case is the header.  
--  Then when you set the absolute positioning, you can set the horizontal and vertical alignments with top and right
--  Now for transform and translate.
    --  When you use transform, you apply 2d transformation to the element.
    --  When you use translate, and in this case match the x and y axis to the the top and right/left positioning, you apply 
        a negative to it to essentially match it and bring it to where you want it.

--  So basically for this step, you want to select each element (i.e. image, text, etc.) and do the following:
    --  set display: absolute so that you put the element outside normal flow and you can position it wherever you want.
    --  Set the vertical and horizontal position with top and left/right (i.e. 50% top and 50% left will center the element).
    --  set transform: translate (i.e. translate(x,y)) with the x axis being the horizontal and y being vertical but also adding a 
        negative to it.

                        .kiwi {                                                                                                 
                            position: absolute;                                                                                     
                            height: 600px;                                                                                           
                            top: 90%;                                                                                                
                            right: 10%;                                                                                              
                            transform: translate(-10%, -90%);                                                                        
                        }

    -- note that transform is applied just to the kiwi for a 2 dimensional effect in contrast to the other elements.


STEP 3: Set the seperate section:
================================
-- set the height of the section below to 100vh.  What happens here is that the section will be the same viewport size like we have
   in the parallax section above, but essentially color block over it.
-- Note that you could do whatever you want with this section, whether that be the solid color we have in the study, reconfigure
   some of the images to extend over this section, or even have another paralax section.



STEP 4: write logic for parallax 
================================
-- The objective here to select one of the elements that we have (i.e. kiwi, apple, mango, and text) and have them scroll at 
   different speeds by transform/translate the speed at which it moves as we scroll down.

-- In your js file, create a function called parallax.
-- the function will take 3 parameters:
    1. element -- the element we want to select.
    2. distance -- the distance we need to scroll
    3. speed -- the speed at which the selected element will go.

-- The logic of the function is as follows:

        function parallax(element, distance, speed ) {                             
            const item = document.querySelector(element);                       <== for the element selected (stored as a constant names "item")...          
            item.style.transform = `translateY(${distance * speed}px)`          <== the item's style will transform based on the specified distance and speed   
        }        


STEP 5: Add event listeners for each element that you want to scroll in parallax
================================================================================
-- on scroll, run functions for each element 
-- remember adjust the distance and scoll for each elemement accordingly.


STEP 6: Make layering adjustments to elements with z-index
=================================================
-- layering will make some of the fruits layer over the others with lesser rating.
